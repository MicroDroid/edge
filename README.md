Ivan is a JavaScript runtime which has native ES Modules and shares many browser spec globals.

Ivan's source is based heavily on Node.js because Ivan is my way of learning about Node.js core.

Ivan does not currently have any bare import specifiers but if it did they would be prefixed with `@ivan`
